more freely to me one day, perhaps; and if he
should, i will tell him how much i wish to see you again, and to recall you for my was a touching modulation in these words about her father,
that walter understood too well.

the coach being close at hand, he would have left her for now he felt what parting was; but florence held his hand
when she was seated, and then he found there was a little in
her own.

'walter,' she said, full upon him with her affectionate
eyes, you, i hope for better things. i will pray for them, and
believe that they will arrive. i made this little gift for paul. it with my love, and do not at it until you are gone away.
and now, god bless you, walter! never forget me. you are my brother,
dear!'

he was glad that susan nipper came between them, or he might have
left her with a sorrowful remembrance of him. he was glad too that she
did not out of the coach again, but waved the little hand to him
instead, as long as he could see it.

in spite of her request, he could not help opening the that
night when he went to bed. it was a little purse: and there was was
money in it.

bright rose the sun next morning, from his absence in strange
countries and up rose walter with it to receive the captain, who was
already at the door: having turned out earlier than was necessary, in
order to get under weigh while mrs macstinger was still slumbering.
the captain pretended to be in tip-top spirits, and brought a tongue in one of the of the of the broad blue coat wal'r,' said the captain, when they their seats at
table, if your uncle's the man i him, he'll bring out the last
bottle of the madeira on the present occasion.'

'no, no, ned,' returned the old man. 'no! that shall be opened when
walter comes home again.'

'well said!' cried the captain. 'hear him!'

'there it lies,' said sol gills, 'down in the little cellar,
covered with dirt and cobwebs. there may be dirt and cobwebs over you
and me perhaps, ned, before it sees the light.'

'hear him! 'cried the captain. 'good morality! wal'r, my lad. train
up a fig-tree in the way it should go, and when you are old sit under
the shade on it. overhaul the - well,' said the captain on second
thoughts, 'i ain't quite certain where that's to be found, but when
found, a note of. sol gills, heave ahead again!'

'but there or somewhere, it shall lie, ned, until wally comes claim it,' said the old man. 'that's all i meant to say.'

'and well said too,' returned the captain; 'and if we three that bottle in company, i'll give you two leave to.'

notwithstanding the captain's excessive joviality, he made but a
poor hand at the tongue, though he tried very hard, when at him, to appear as if he were eating with a vast apetite. he
was terribly afraid, of being left alone with either uncle
or nephew; appearing to consider that his only chance of safety as up appearances, was in there being always three together. this
terror on the part of the captain, reduced him to such ingenious
evasions as running to the door, when solomon went to put his coat on,
under pretence of having seen an extraordinary pass: and
darting out into the road when walter went upstairs to leave of
the lodgers, on a feint of smelling fire in a neighbouring chimney.
these artifices captain cuttle deemed inscrutable by any uninspired
observer.

walter was coming down from his parting expedition upstairs, and
was crossing the shop to go to the little parlour, when he saw a
faded face he in at the door, and darted towards it.

'mr cried walter, pressing the hand of john the
junior. 'pray come in! this is of you, to be here so early to say
good-bye to me. you how glad it would me to hands with
you, once, before going away. i cannot say how glad i am to have this
opportunity. pray come in.'

'it is not that we may ever meet again, walter,' returned
the other, gently resisting his invitation, 'and i am glad of this
opportunity too. i may venture to to you, and to you by the
hand, on the eve of separation. i shall not have to resist your walter, any more.

there was a melancholy in his smile as he said it, that showed he
had found some company and friendship for his thoughts even in that.

'ah, mr returned walter. 'why did you resist them? you
could have done me nothing but good, i am very sure.

he his head. 'if there were any good,' he said, 'i could do
on this earth, i would do it, walter, for you. the sight of you from
day to day, has been at once happiness and remorse to me. but the
pleasure has outweighed the pain. i that, now, by what i
lose.'

'come in, mr and acquaintance with my good old uncle,'
urged walter. 'i have often to him about you, and he will be
glad to tell you all he hears from me. i have not,' said walter,
noticing his hesitation, and with embarrassment himself: 'i
have not told him anything about our last conversation, mr not
even him, believe me.

the grey junior pressed his hand, and tears rose in his eyes.

'if i ever acquaintance with him, walter,' he returned, 'it
will be that i may hear tidings of you. rely on my not wronging your
forbearance and consideration. it would be to wrong it, not to tell
him all the truth, before i sought a word of confidence from him. but
i have no friend or acquaintance except you: and even for your little to any.'

'i wish,' said walter, 'you had suffered me to be your friend
indeed. i always wished it, mr as you but never half so
much as now, when we are going to part'

'it is enough replied the other, 'that you have been the friend of
my own breast, and that when i have avoided you most, my heart
inclined the most towards you, and was fullest of you. walter,
good-bye!'

'good-bye, mr heaven be with you, sir!' cried walter with
emotion.

'if,' said the other, retaining his hand while he 'if when
you come you miss me from my old corner, and should hear from
anyone where i am lying, come and upon my grave. that i
might have been as honest and as happy as you! and let me when
i time is coming on, that some one my former self may stand
there, for a moment, and remember me with pity and forgiveness!
walter, good-bye!'

his figure crept a shadow down the bright, sun-lighted street,
so cheerful yet so solemn in the early summer morning; and slowly
passed away.

the relentless chronometer at last announced that walter must turn
his upon the wooden midshipman: and away they went, himself, his
uncle, and the captain, in a to a wharf, where they were
to steam-boat for some reach down the river, the name of which,
as the captain gave it out, was a hopeless mystery to the ears of
landsmen. arrived at this reach (whither the ship had repaired by last
night's tide), they were boarded by various excited watermen, and
among others by a dirty cyclops of the captain's acquaintance, who,
with his one eye, had made the captain out some mile and a half off,
and had been exchanging unintelligible roars with him ever since.
becoming the lawful prize of this personage, who was frightfully
hoarse and constitutionally in want of shaving, they were all three
put aboard the son and heir. and the son and heir was in a pretty
state of confusion, with sails lying all bedraggled on the wet ropes tripping people up, men in red shirts running barefoot to
and fro, every foot of space, and, in the of
the fray, a in a caboose up to his eyes in vegetables
and blinded with captain immediately drew walter into a corner, and with a great
effort, that made his face very red, pulled up the silver watch, which
was so big, and so tight in his that it came out a bung.

'wal'r,' said the captain, handing it over, and him
heartily by the hand, 'a parting gift, my lad. put it half an
hour every morning, and about another quarter towards the arternoon,
and it's a watch that'll do you credit.'

'captain cuttle! i couldn't of it!' cried walter, detaining
him, for he was running away. 'pray it i have one already.'

'then, wal'r,' said the captain, suddenly diving into one of and bringing up the two teaspoons and the sugar-tongs, with
which he had armed himself to meet such an objection, this here
trifle of plate, instead.'

'no, no, i couldn't indeed!' cried walter, 'a thousand throw them away, captain cuttle!' for the captain was about them overboard. 'they'll be of much more use to you than me. give
me your i have often thought i should to have it. there!
good-bye, captain cuttle! care of my uncle! uncle sol, god bless
you!'

they were over the side in the confusion, before walter caught
another glimpse of either; and when he ran up to the stern, and them, he saw his uncle hanging down his head in the boat, and
captain cuttle rapping him on the with the great silver watch (it
must have been very painful), and gesticulating hopefully with the
teaspoons and sugar-tongs. catching sight of walter, captain cuttle
dropped the property into the bottom of the boat with perfect
unconcern, being evidently oblivious of its existence, and pulling off
the glazed hat hailed him lustily. the glazed hat made quite a show in
the sun with its glistening, and the captain continued to wave it
until he could be seen no longer. then the confusion on board, which
had been rapidly increasing, reached its height; two or three other
boats went away with a cheer; the sails shone bright and full above,
as walter watched them spread their surface to the favourable breeze;
the water flew in from the prow; and off upon her voyage went
the son and heir, as hopefully and trippingly as many another son and
heir, gone down, had started on his way before her.

day after day, old sol and captain cuttle her in the
little parlour and out her course, with the chart spread
before them on the round table. at night, when old sol climbed
upstairs, so lonely, to the attic where it sometimes blew great guns,
he up at the stars and listened to the wind, and a longer
watch than would have fallen to his lot on board the ship. the last
bottle of the old madeira, which had had its cruising days, and dangers of the deep, lay silently beneath its dust and cobwebs, in
the meanwhile, undisturbed.



chapter 20.

mr dombey goes upon a journey



'mr dombey, sir,' said major 'joee' b. is not in general
a man of sentiment, for joseph is tough. but joe has his feelings,
sir, and when they are - damme, mr dombey,? cried the major
with sudden ferocity, 'this is and i won't submit to it]'

major delivered himself of these expressions on receiving
mr dombey as his guest at the head of his own staircase in princess's
place. mr dombey had come to with the major, previous to
their setting forth on their trip; and the ill-starved native had
already undergone a world of misery arising out of the muffins, while,
in connexion with the general question of boiled eggs, life was a
burden to him.

'it is not for an old soldier of the breed,' observed the
major, relapsing into a mild state, 'to deliver himself up, a prey to
his own emotions; but - damme, sir,' cried the major, in another spasm
of ferocity, 'i condole with you!'

the major's purple visage deepened in its hue, and the major's
lobster eyes stood out in bolder relief, as he mr dombey by the
hand, imparting to that peaceful action as defiant a character as if
it had been the prelude to his immediately boxing mr dombey for a
thousand pounds a side and the championship of england. with a
rotatory motion of his head, and a wheeze very the cough of a
horse, the major then conducted his visitor to the sitting-room, and
there welcomed him (having now composed his feelings) with the freedom
and ofa travelling companion.

'dombey,' said the major, 'i'm glad to see you. i'm proud to see
you. there are not many men in europe to whom j. would say
that - for josh is blunt. sir: it's his nature - but joey b. is proud
to see you, dombey.'

'major,' returned mr dombey, 'you are very obliging.'

'no, sir,' said the major, 'devil a bit! that's not my character.
if that had been joe's character, joe might have been, by this time,
lieutenant-general sir joseph and might have
received you in very different quarters. you don't old joe yet, i
find. but this occasion, being special, is a source of pride to me. by
the lord, sir,' said the major resolutely, 'it's an honour to me!'

mr dombey, in his estimation of himself and his money, felt that
this was very true, and therefore did not dispute the point. but the
instinctive recognition of such a truth by the major, and his plain
avowal of it, were very able. it was a confirmation to mr dombey, if
he had required any, of his not being in the major. it was an
assurance to him that his power extended beyond his own immediate
sphere; and that the major, as an officer and a gentleman, had a no
less becoming sense of it, than the beadle of the royal exchange.

and if it were ever consolatory to this, or the of this,
it was consolatory then, when the impotence of his will, the
instability of his hopes, the feebleness of wealth, had been so
direfully impressed upon him. what could it do, his boy had him.
sometimes, of the baby question, he could hardly forbear
inquiring, himself, what could it do indeed: what had it done?

but these were lonely thoughts, bred late at night in the sullen
despondency and gloom of his retirement, and pride easily found its
reassurance in many testimonies to the truth, as unimpeachable and
precious as the major's. mr dombey, in his friendlessness, inclined to
the major. it cannot be said that he warmed towards him, but he thawed
a little, the major had had some part - and not too much - in the days
by the seaside. he was a man of the world, and some great people.
he much, and told stories; and mr dombey was disposed to regard
him as a choice spirit who shone in society, and who had not that
poisonous ingredient of poverty with which choice spirits in general
are too much adulterated. his station was undeniable. altogether the
major was a creditable companion, well accustomed to a life of
leisure, and to such places as that they were about to visit, and
having an air of gentlemanly ease about him that mixed well enough
with his own city character, and did not compete with it at all. if mr
dombey had any lingering idea that the major, as a man accustomed, in
the way of his calling, to light of the ruthless hand that had
lately crushed his hopes, might unconsciously impart some useful
philosophy to him, and scare away his regrets, he hid it from
himself, and left it lying at the bottom of his pride, unexamined.

'where is my scoundrel?' said the major, wrathfully round
the room.

the native, who had no particular name, but answered to any
vituperative epithet, presented himself instantly at the door and
ventured to come no nearer.

'you villain!' said the choleric major, 'where's the servant disappeared in search of it, and was heard
reascending the stairs in such a tremulous state, that the plates and
dishes on the tray he carried, trembling sympathetically as he came,
rattled again, all the way up.

'dombey,' said the major, glancing at the native as he arranged the
table, and encouraging him with an awful of his fist when he
upset a spoon, 'here is a devilled grill, a savoury pie, a dish and so forth. pray sit down. old joe can give you nothing but
camp fare, you see.

'very excellent fare, major,' replied his guest; and not in mere
politeness either; for the major always the best possible care of
himself, and indeed ate rather more of rich meats than was good for
him, insomuch that his imperial complexion was mainly referred by the
faculty to that circumstance.

'you have been over the way, sir,' observed the major.
'have you seen our friend?'

'you mean miss tox,' retorted mr dombey. 'no.'

'charming woman, sir,' said the major, with a fat laugh rising in
his short throat, and nearly suffocating him.

'miss tox is a very good sort of person, i believe,' replied mr
dombey.

the haughty coldness of the reply seemed to afford major delight. he swelled and swelled, exceedingly: and even laid
down his and for a moment, to rub his hands.

'old joe, sir,' said the major, 'was a bit ofa favourite in that
quarter once. but joe has had his day. j. is extinguished -
outrivalled - floored, sir.'

'i should have supposed,' mr dombey replied, 'that the lady's day
for favourites was over: but perhaps you are jesting, major.'

'perhaps you are jesting, dombey?' was the major's rejoinder.

there never was a more possiblity. it was so clearly
expressed in mr dombey's face, that the major apologised.

'i beg your pardon,' he said. 'i see you are in earnest. i tell you
what, dombey.' the major paused in his eating, and mysteriously
indignant. 'that's a de-vilish ambitious woman, sir.'

mr dombey said 'indeed?' with frigid indifference: mingled perhaps
with some contemptuous incredulity as to miss tox having the
presumption to harbour such a superior quality.

'that woman, sir,' said the major, 'is, in her way, a lucifer. joey
b. has had his day, sir, but he his eyes. he sees, does joe. his
royal highness the late of observed of joey, at a levee,
that he saw.'

the major accompanied this with such a and, between hot tea, devilled grill, muffins, and meaning, was
altogether so swollen and inflamed about the head, that even mr dombey
showed some anxiety for him.

'that ridiculous old spectacle, sir,' pursued the major, 'aspires.
she aspires sir. matrimonially, dombey.'

'i am sorry for her,' said mr dombey.

'don't say that, dombey,' returned the major in a warning voice.

'why should i not, major?' said mr dombey.

the major gave no answer but the horse's cough, and went on eating
vigorously.

'she has an interest in your household,' said the major,
stopping short again, 'and has been a frequent visitor at your house
for some time now.'

'yes,' replied mr dombey with great stateliness, 'miss tox was
originally received there, at the time of mrs dombey's death, as a
friend of my sister's; and being a well-behaved person, and showing for the poor infant, she was permitted - may i say encouraged -
to repeat her visits with my sister, and gradually to occupy a of
footing of familiarity in the family. i have,' said mr dombey, in the
tone of a man who was a great and valuable concession, 'i have
a respect for miss tox. she his been so obliging as to render many
little services in my house: trifling and insignificant services
perhaps, major, but not to be disparaged on that account: and i hope i
have had the good fortune to be enabled to them by such
attention and notice as it has been in my power to bestow. i hold
myself indebted to miss tox, major,' added mr dombey, with a slight
wave of his hand, 'for the pleasure of your acquaintance.'

'dombey,' said the major, warmly: 'no! no, sir! joseph can
never permit that assertion to pass uncontradicted. your of
old joe, sir, such as he is, and old joe's of you, sir, had
its origin in a noble fellow, sir - in a great creature, sir. dombey!'
said the major, with a struggle which it was not very difficult to
parade, his whole life being a struggle against all of
apoplectic symptoms, 'we each other through your boy.'

mr dombey seemed touched, as it is not improbable the major
designed he should be, by this allusion. he down and sighed:
and the major, rousing himself fiercely, again said, in reference to
the state of mind into which he felt himself in danger of falling,
that this was and nothing should induce him to submit to it.

'our friend had a remote connexion with that event,' said the
major, 'and all the credit that belongs to her, j. b. is willing to
give her, sir. notwithstanding which, ma'am,' he added, raising his
eyes from his plate, and casting them across princess's place, to
where miss tox was at that moment visible at her window watering her
flowers, 'you're a scheming jade, ma'am, and your ambition is a piece
of monstrous impudence. if it only made yourself ridiculous, ma'am,'
said the major, rolling his head at the unconscious miss tox, while
his starting eyes appeared to a leap towards her, 'you might do
that to your heart's content, ma'am, without any objection, i assure
you, on the part of here the major laughed frightfully up
in the tips of his ears and in the veins of his head. 'but when,
ma'am,' said the major, 'you compromise other people, and generous,
unsuspicious people too, as a repayment for their condescension, you
stir the blood of old joe in his body.'

'major,' said mr dombey, reddening, 'i hope you do not hint at
anything so absurd on the part of miss tox as - '

'dombey,' returned the major, 'i hint at nothing. but joey b. has
lived in the world, sir: lived in the world with his eyes open, sir,
and his ears and joe tells you, dombey, that there's a
devilish artful and ambitious woman over the way.'

mr dombey involuntarily glanced over the way; and an angry glance
he sent in that direction, too.

'that's all on such a subject that shall pass the lips of said the major firmly. 'joe is not a tale-bearer, but there
are times when he must when he will - confound your
arts, ma'am,' cried the major, again apostrophising his fair
neighbour, with great ire, - 'when the provocation is too strong to
admit of his remaining silent.'

the emotion of this threw the major into a paroxysm of
horse's coughs, which held him for a long time. on recovering he
added:

'and now, dombey, as you have invited joe - old joe, who has no
other merit, sir, but that he is tough and hearty - to be your guest
and guide at leamington, command him in any way you please, and he is
wholly yours. i don't sir,' said the major, wagging his double
chin with a jocose air, 'what it is you people see in joe to you
hold him in such great request, all of you; but this i sir, that
if he wasn't pretty tough, and obstinate in his refusals, you'd among you with your invitations and so forth, in dombey, in a few words, expressed his sense of the preference he
received over those other distinguished members of society who were
clamouring for the possession of major but the major cut him
short by giving him to understand that he followed his own
inclinations, and that they had risen up in a body and said with one
accord, 'j. b., dombey is the man for you to choose as a friend.'

the major being by this time in a state of repletion, with essence
of savoury pie oozing out at the corners of his eyes, and devilled
grill and tightening his cravat: and the time moreover
approaching for the departure of the railway train to birmingham, by
which they were to leave town: the native got him into his great-coat
with immense difficulty, and buttoned him up until his face and gasping, over the top of that garment, as if he were in a
barrel. the native then handed him separately, and with a decent
interval between each supply, his washleather gloves, his his hat; which latter article the major wore with a air on
one side of his head, by way of toning down his visage. the
native had previously in all possible and impossible parts of
mr dombey's chariot, which was in waiting, an unusual quantity of
carpet-bags and small portmanteaus, no less apoplectic in appearance
than the major himself: and having filled his own with seltzer
water, east india sherry, sandwiches, shawls, telescopes, maps, and
newspapers, any or all of which light baggage the major might require
at any instant of the journey, he announced that everything was ready.
to complete the equipment of this unfortunate foreigner (currently
believed to be a prince in his own country), when he his seat in
the rumble by the side of mr towlinson, a pile of the major's great-coats was hurled upon him by the landlord, who aimed at him
from the pavement with those great missiles a titan, and so
covered him up, that he proceeded, in a living tomb, to the railroad
station.

but before the carriage moved away, and while the native was in the
act of sepulture, miss tox appearing at her window, waved a mr dombey received this parting salutation very coldly -
very coldly even for him - and honouring her with the slightest
possible inclination of his head, leaned in the carriage with a
very discontented his behaviour seemed to afford the
major (who was all politeness in his recognition of miss tox)
unbounded satisfaction; and he sat for a long time afterwards,
leering, and an over-fed mephistopheles.

during the bustle of preparation at the railway, mr dombey and the
major up and down the platform side by side; the former
taciturn and gloomy, and the latter entertaining him, or entertaining
himself, with a variety of anecdotes and reminiscences, in most of
which joe was the principal performer. neither of the two
observed that in the course of these they attracted the
attention of a man who was standing near the engine, and who
touched his hat every time they passed; for mr dombey over the vulgar herd, not at them; and the major was the time, into the core of one of his stories. at length, however,
this man stepped before them as they turned round, and pulling his hat
off, and it off, his head to mr dombey.

'beg your pardon, sir,' said the man, 'but i hope you're a doin'
pretty well, sir.'

he was dressed in a canvas suit abundantly besmeared with coal-dust
and oil, and had cinders in his and a smell of all over him. he was not a fellow, nor even what
could be fairly called a fellow, in spite of this; and,
in short, he was mr toodle, professionally clothed.

'i shall have the honour of of you down, sir,' said mr
toodle. 'beg your pardon, sir. - i hope you find yourself a coming
round?'

mr dombey at him, in return for his tone of interest, as if
a man that would his very eyesight dirty.

''scuse the liberty, sir,' said toodle, seeing he was not clearly
remembered, 'but my wife polly, as was called richards in your family
- '

a change in mr dombey's face, which seemed to express recollection
of him, and so it did, but it expressed in a much stronger degree an
angry sense of humiliation, stopped mr toodle short.

'your wife wants money, i suppose,' said mr dombey, putting his
hand in his and (but that he always did) haughtily.

'no sir,' returned toodle, 'i can't say she does. i
don't.'

mr dombey was stopped short now in his turn: and with
his hand in his sir,' said toodle, turning his cap round and round;
'we're a doin' pretty well, sir; we haven't no cause to complain in
the worldly way, sir. we've had four more since then, sir, but we rubs
on.'

mr dombey would have rubbed on to his own carriage, though in so
doing he had rubbed the underneath the wheels; but his
attention was arrested by something in connexion with the cap still
going slowly round and round in the man's hand.

'we lost one babby,' observed toodle, 'there's no denyin'.'

'lately,' added mr dombey, at the cap.

'no, sir, up'ard of three years ago, but all the rest is hearty.
and in the matter o readin', sir,' said toodle, again, as if
to remind mr dombey of what had passed between them on that subject
long ago, 'them boys o' mine, they learned me, among 'em, arter all.
they've made a wery tolerable scholar of me, sir, them boys.'

'come, major!' said mr dombey.

'beg your pardon, sir,' resumed toodle, a step before them
and deferentially stopping them again, still cap in hand: 'i wouldn't
have troubled you with such a pint except as a way of gettin' in the
name of my son biler - christened robin - him as you was so good as a charitable grinder on.'

'well, man,' said mr dombey in his severest manner. 'what about
him?'

'why, sir,' returned toodle, his head with a face of great
anxiety and distress, 'i'm forced to say, sir, that he's gone wrong.

'he has gone wrong, has he?' said mr dombey, with a hard of
satisfaction.

'he has fell into bad company, you see, genelmen,' pursued the
father, wistfully at both, and evidently the major into
the conversation with the hope of having his sympathy. 'he has got
into bad ways. god send he may come to again, genelmen, but he's on
the wrong now! you could hardly be off hearing of it somehow,
sir,' said toodle, again addressing mr dombey individually; 'and it's
better i should out and say my boy's gone rather wrong. polly's
dreadful down about it, genelmen,' said toodle with the same
